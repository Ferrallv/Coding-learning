The differences between func(ResponseWriter, *Request) and HandlerFunc are explained and illustrated.

A Handler is an interface which gives the type Handler to any type that includes the method ServeHTTP which takes a ResponseWriter and a pointer to a Request.

ListenAndServe takes a Handler!

The way we do routing is with a ServeMux. NewServeMux gvies us back a type pointer to a ServeMux. A serveMux implements ServeHTTP which means it is a Handler and THEREFORE we can put in into ListenAndServe.

ServeMux has other methods attached to it. Handle and FuncHandler.

Handle takes a Handler.  

HandleFunc takes a function with the paramaters ResponseWriter and *Request. This is different from a Handler, although it has the same parameters. It is it's own type.

HandleFunc takes a route and a func that has the parameters ResponseWriter and *Request.

ListenAndServe can take nil as the Handler and so will implement the default ServeMux. Handle and HandleFunc can be used to create routes for the DefaultMux.
