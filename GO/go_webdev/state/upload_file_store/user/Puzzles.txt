Final puzzle.

The final boss battle is not winnable through direct confrontation. There are two ways to defeat Bennett. One is to cut the power to the portal. This can be done by severing the cables in the final chamber. The second can be to enter the three appropriate sigils into the console in the ante-chamber.

first sigil will be found on the shack floor, the next two will be on the second floor.

The sigils will be entrance, infinity, timeout.

entrance will be the sigil found in the shack.
